# DIFFERENCE CALCULATOR

This project implements a console application designed to compare three provided files in either YAML, YML, or JSON format. 
It identifies the differences between the files and generates a new file displaying the detected discrepancies. 
The output can be customized into one of three available formats:

 - Stylish format
 - Plain text format
 - JSON format (default)

The application allows users to easily compare configuration files, detect changes, and choose the most suitable format 
for displaying the differences.
